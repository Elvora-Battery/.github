# Token-Based Battery Rental App for Electric Vehicle Inspection - Revolutionizing the TIC Industry

Welcome to our innovative project submission for **SCIence HackFest 2024**! We are a team passionate about transforming the Testing, Inspection, and Certification (TIC) industry through cutting-edge technology solutions that improve the efficiency of electric vehicle (EV) inspection, testing, and certification.

![Project Showcase]

## ‚ö° Project Overview

Our project harnesses the power of **machine learning**, and **cloud computing** to provide a state-of-the-art solution for the inspection and certification of electric vehicles. Through this mobile application, we aim to simplify and automate the inspection process, ensuring that electric vehicles meet critical safety, performance, and environmental standards. 

By integrating smart diagnostic tools and data analytics, our platform streamlines workflows for inspection agencies, minimizes human error, and improves overall accuracy in the EV testing process.

## üîã Monthly Battery Rental System

In addition to our inspection solutions, we offer a unique **battery rental system** for electric vehicles, designed to alleviate the high upfront costs of EV batteries. This system is based on a **token-based monthly rental** model, allowing users to rent EV batteries and pay for them on a subscription basis.

- **Token-Based Payment:** EV owners are issued tokens that correspond to battery usage, and payments are required at the end of each month based on token consumption.
- **Flexible Subscription Plans:** Users can choose from different subscription tiers, adjusting battery usage and payment plans according to their needs.
- **Easy Monitoring:** Our app integrates a monitoring system to keep track of token usage and notifies users when it's time to make a payment, ensuring a seamless and hassle-free experience.

This innovative system reduces the initial cost of purchasing an EV, making electric vehicles more accessible and promoting sustainable transportation.

## üåç Why It Matters

As the world transitions to sustainable transportation, electric vehicles play a key role in reducing carbon emissions and achieving climate goals. However, ensuring the safety and efficiency of these vehicles is critical to their mass adoption. Our solution empowers **TIC professionals** to conduct thorough inspections with greater precision and speed, promoting confidence in EV technology and accelerating its adoption globally. Additionally, our battery rental system helps lower barriers to entry for EV ownership, making it easier for consumers to switch to electric.
